# Restful EasyOCR

If you do not know, EasyOCR is an open-sourced project (written in Python, hosted at https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) helps doing OCR Jobs for your text extraction needs. Because it's written in Python, it can be difficult for integrating to your stack. 

This small repository helps wrapping the EasyOCR functionalities inside Restful API with Flask. So that, you do not need to use Python in your stack to work with EasyOCR.
